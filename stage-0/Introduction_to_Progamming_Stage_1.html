<h2>The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
<div>
  <b>How does the web work?</b>
  <p>
  Computers communicate with the internet via http. 
  Requests are sent to servers that send an html file 
  that is interpretted by a web browser for the user. 
  A webpage is a text document written in HTML that is 
  interpreted by a web browser.

  <b>What is HTML?</b>
  <p>
  HTML (hypertext markup language) is the language 
  that tells webpages what to display, how it looks, 
  and where it links. The markup tells it what it 
  looks like and is made up of tags, opening and 
  closing tag make the element. HTML attributes 
  are a property of an element. It's often a good 
  idea to make your closing tag as soon as you make 
  your opening tag so that you don't cause any 
  unexpected problems.

  <b>What does it mean to say "Computers are Stupid"?</b>
  <p>
  There is a need to write in the correct manner for 
  the computer to understand and execute a programming 
  language to have the desired effect. This is because 
  computers follow a set of rules when executing a program. 
  This is called syntax.

  <b>HTML Markup</b>
  <p>
  HTML documents are made up of <em><b>elements</b></em> 
  which are made of <em><b>tags</b></em> surrounding 
  <b><em>contents</em></b> which can be text or other tags.
  HTML <em><b>elements</b></em> can have <em><b>attributes</b></em>.
  An example of an attribute is the "href" attribute contained 
  within the anchor tag which defines a link. The attribute in 
  this case is the link address. For example the element with anchor tag
  that contains the attribute href=www.udacity.com and content "Udacity"
  would result in the link
  <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>.
  </p>

<div>
  <b>Inline and Block Elements</b>
  <p>
  There is an important distinction between these two 
  <em><b>elements.</em></b> Block elements render an invisible "block" 
  that can have a height and width. Both affect <em><b>whitespace</b></em> 
  which is affected by elements as opposed to actual spaces in the code.
