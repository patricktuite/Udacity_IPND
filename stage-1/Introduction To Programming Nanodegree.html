          <p>
            Computers communicate with the internet via http. 
            Requests are sent to servers that send an html file 
            that is interpretted by a web browser for the user. 
            A webpage is a text document written in HTML that is 
            interpreted by a web browser.

        <div class="lesson-note-content">
          <p>
            HTML (hypertext markup language) is the language 
            that tells webpages what to display, how it looks, 
            and where it links. The markup tells it what it 
            looks like and is made up of tags, opening and 
            closing tag make the element. HTML attributes 
            are a property of an element. It's often a good 
            idea to make your closing tag as soon as you make 
            your opening tag so that you don't cause any 
            unexpected problems.

            There is a need to write in the correct manner for 
            the computer to understand and execute a programming 
            language to have the desired effect. This is because 
            computers follow a set of rules when executing a program. 
            This is called syntax.

        <div class="lesson-note-content">
          <p>
            HTML documents are made up of <span class="emphasis">elements</span> 
            which are made of <span class="emphasis">tags</span> surrounding 
            <span class="emphasis">contents</span> which can be text or other tags.
            HTML <span class="emphasis">elements</span> can have <span class="emphasis">attributes</span>.
            An example of an attribute is the "href" attribute contained 
            within the anchor tag which defines a link. The attribute in 
            this case is the link address. For example the element with anchor tag
            that contains the attribute href=www.udacity.com and content "Udacity"
            would result in the link <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>.

            There is an important distinction between these two 
            <span class="emphasis">elements.</span> Block elements render an invisible "block" 
            that can have a height and width. Both affect <span class="emphasis">whitespace</span> 
            which is affected by elements as opposed to actual spaces in the code.

          <p>
            One way to think of a website is that it is constructed like a house. HTML tells you where the walls are and which room is which. CSS tells you what color the walls are, what color the carpet is, decorations. Javascript is an interactive part like the garage door.

            In the markup language elements can have other element inside of them. This is known has a "tree like structure" which according to Wikipedia is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure">"A tree structure or tree diagram is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form."</a>

          Devloper Tools and the Box Model
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-note-content">
          <p>
            Developer tools in the web browser give the user a full view of the code of the page. Here it is seen that there are two different languages at work. HTML which controls the structure of the page and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which describes the stle (look and format) of the HTML (markup language). 
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span class="emphasis">Document Object Model</span> or DOM is the tree like stucture of a page that comes from the HTML and CSS. HTML is a language with syntax and rules and broswer turns the words or tags of HTML into elements in the DOM tree. HTML defines the structure. CSS defines the style.

        <div class="lesson-note-content">
          <p>
            All elements of webpages can be broken up into boxes. When working on a page it can be helpful to break things down into boxes working big to small filling in content later. Boxes are defined by the DIV tag and like other elements can be nested inside of other DIV tags. It is helpful to label boxes to define them with style later on this is accomplished with class attributes which can be thought of as labels on boxes. Multiple labels can be applied to the same box.

          What is CSS?  
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-note-content">
          <p>
            CSS which stands for <span class="emphasis">Cascading Style Sheets</span> is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements. It controls how the html looks to the viewer of the webpage.

        <div class="lesson-note-content">
          <p>
            CSS is thought of as a series of rules that apply style to elements of html, CSS applies the most specific rule. The example given in the lesson is regarding laws National Laws>State Laws>Municipal>House Rules. The rule that best describes the element gets applied

          Repetition and Inheritance 
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-note-content">
          <p>
            A key concept in coding is avoiding repetition which allows the coder to avoid unnecessary work, avoid errors, and have conistent code. A feature of CSS that helps with avoiding repetition is <span class="emphasis">inheritance</span>. Inheritance allows for the same style to be applied to multiple elements. This is because of the features of the tree like structure of hmtl which allows CSS properties to be applied to all decendant elements.

            In the lesson Jessica outlines a strategy for creating webpages:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Look for natural boxes</li>
            <li>Look for repeated styles and semantics</li>
            <li>Write html</li>
            <li>Apply styles biggest to smallest</li>
            <li>Fix the small things</li>
